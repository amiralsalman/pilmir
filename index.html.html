		<p style="color:#FFFAF0; text-align:center; font-size:30px"> 
			It all started with a pubg game, what I can say is that love comes in a way that you can't expect it,
			and yes, she came. We started talking, enjoying or time together, knowing each other, and suddenly, out of nowhere,
			on the 30 of july, Pilar said the first <b>I LOVE YOU</b>. Well to be honest, I was in love with her from the first
			moment, I felt that she is the one, she is the girl that I want to be with, yes she is <b>MY SOULMATE</b>. And every thing
			started to work out perfectly, we loved each other every day more than the day before.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p style="color:#FFFAF0; text-align:center; font-size:30px">
			Pilar, I love you to the moon and never back, you are my everything, and you will stay like this 
			for ever. You mean the word to me, and you will always do. 
		</p>
